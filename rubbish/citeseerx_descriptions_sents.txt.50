Wittmeyer’s pseudoinverse iterative algorithm is formulated&#13;
Multiple-Phased Systems, whose operational life can be partitioned in a set of disjoint periods, called Â¿phasesÂ¿; include several classes of systems such as Phased Mission Systems and Scheduled Maintenance Systems.
Because of their deployment in critical applications, the dependability modeling and analysis of Multiple-Phased Systems is a task of primary relevance.
However, the phased behavior makes the analysis of Multiple-Phased Systems extremely complex.
This paper is centered on the description and application of DEEM, a dependability modeling and evaluation tool for Multiple Phased Systems.
DEEM supports a powerful and efficient methodology for the analytical dependability modeling and evaluation of Multiple Phased Systems, based on Deterministic and Stochastic Petri Nets and on Markov Regenerative Processes.
As a first step toward realizing a dynamical system that evolves while spontaneously determining its own rule for time evolution, function dynamics (FD) is analyzed.
FD consists of a functional equation with a self-referential term, given as a dynamical system of a one-dimensional map.
Through the time evolution of this system, a dynamical graph (a network) emerges.
This graph has three interesting properties: (i) vertices appear as stable elements, (ii) the terminals of directed edges change in time, and (iii) some vertices determine the dynamics of edges, and edges determine the stability of the vertices, complementarily.
Two aspects of FD are studied, the generation of a graph (network) structure and the dynamics of this graph (network) in the system.
A simulation model is successful if it leads to policy action, i.e., if it is implemented.
Studies show that for a model to be implemented, it must have good correspondence with the mental model of the system held by the user of the model.
The user must feel confident that the simulation model corresponds to this mental model.
An understanding of how the model works is required.
Simulation models for implementation must be developed step by step, starting with a simple model, the simulation prototype.
After this has been explained to the user, a more detailed model can be developed on the basis of feedback from the user.
Software for simulation prototyping is discussed, e.g., with regard to the ease with which models and output can be explained and the speed with which small models can be written.
Hedging of fixed income securities remains one of the most challenging problems faced by financial institutions.
The predominantly used measures of duration and convexity do not completely capture the interest rate risks borne by the holder of these securities.
Using historical data for the entire yield curve, we perform a principal components analysis and find that the first four factors capture over 99.99% of the yield curve variation.
Incorporating these factors into the pricing of arbitrary fixed income securities via Monte Carlo simulation, we derive perturbation analysis (PA) estimators for the price sensitivities with respect to the factors.
Computational results for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) indicate that using these sensitivity measures in hedging provides far more protection against interest risk exposure than the conventional measures of duration and convexity.
As ubiquitous computing emerges in our lives and cities new opportunities for artistic and otherwise cultural interventions in urban space follow, but so far not much work has been done in order to articulate the socio-cultural significance of these new opportunities.
This paper is part of a general attempt to develop a coherent understanding of the implications and potentials of ubiquitous computing in the context of everyday city life.
On a more specific level the paper examines how the notion of social friction can be helpful in the development and analysis of ubiquitous computing in relation to art and design.
Social friction is articulated as a critical position, which could be applied as a strategy for design.
Our approach consists of a theoretical analysis and precedes concrete development and real-life experiments.
As such the paper aims to establish a steppingstone from which to launch actual digital designs.
We argue that by designing for the social friction, which is an intrinsic characteristic of everyday life, new forms of social and cultural potentials can be released.
By means of discussing CityNova, a vision for a possible use of ubiquitous computing in urban space, we explore how this approach might lead to systems that create new ways of experiencing the city.
This paper addresses the optimization of FIR filters for low power.
We propose a search algorithm to find the combination of the number of taps and coe#cient bit-width that leads to the minimum number of total partial sums, and hence to the least power consumption.
We show that the minimum number of taps does not necessarily lead to the least power consumption in fully parallel FIR filter architectures.
This is particularly true if the reduction of the bit-width of the coe#cients is taken into account.
We show that power is directly related to the total number of partial sums in the FIR filter, which in turn is determined by the number of bits set to 1 in the coe#cients.
We have developed a search algorithm that achieves up to 36% less power consumption when compared to an implementation using the minimum number of taps.
Educational research has highlighted the importance of maintaining an orderly classroom environment and providing both clear and well-organized instruction tailored to the needs of individual students.
Time spent on direct instruction and particularly the direct instruction of basic skills is associated with school learning (Wang, Haertel &amp;amp; Walberg, 1993).
With the increased interest in constructivistic conceptions of learning and teaching today, educators with constructivistic orientations contend that various forms of knowledge and skills are applied more generally when constructed by the learners themselves as opposed to explicitly taught: &amp;quot;knowledge is made, not acquired&amp;quot; (Phillips, 2000, p. 7).
Such a view nevertheless often leads to an inclination to reject direct instruction by the teacher (see, for example, Brooks &amp;amp; Brooks, 1993).
It should be noted, however, that many of the discussions of constructivistic orientations to learning and instruction are at the level of slogan and clichÃ© (Duffy &amp;amp; Cunningham, 1996; Finn &amp;amp; Ravitch, 1996; Kozloff, 1998).
In addition, the term constructivism has come to serve as an umbrella term for a diversity of views (Phillips, 1995; 2000).
We believe that a broad class of future applications will span both the Internet and the telephone network because such multiplanar applications have several economic and architectural advantages over conventional ones.
We also envision the close interlinking of the telephone network and the Internet to form a multimodal network.
In this paper, we describe these applications and networks, outline their architecture, and present our experiences in constructing a prototype multiplanar application.
We devise a simple model to study the phenomenon of free-riding and the effect of free identities on user behavior in peer-to-peer systems.
At the heart of our model is a strategic user of a certain type, an intrinsic and private parameter that reflects the user&amp;apos;s generosity.
The user decides whether to contribute or free-ride based on how the current burden of contributing in the system compares to her type.
We derive the emerging cooperation level in equilibrium and  quantify the effect of providing free-riders with degraded service on the emerging cooperation.
